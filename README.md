PHP Collection Classes
=============================

Simply clone or download this code and run the PHP inbuilt browser

PHP -S localhost:8080

visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.


You can experiment with the SongCollection or AlbumColection class or use them as the basis to create other collection classes.
 
For example, why not try to create a ConcertsCollection, and add properties and calculations for TicketsSold, TicketsRemaining, AverageTicketsPerConcert etc

*REMEMBER* the strength of the collection, over the array as that it is made of more than its members.
Collections can gave properties and methods outside of the members.
